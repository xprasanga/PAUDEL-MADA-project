# results

This folder and subfolders contain results produced by the code, such as figures and tables, and other files.

A special folder for large files exists. This folder is set in .gitignore to be ignored when pushing/pulling.

The `supplementary-tables` folder contains the preliminary regression model used to obtain the important predictor variables for the main model.
