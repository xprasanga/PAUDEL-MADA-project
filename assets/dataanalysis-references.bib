abstract = {Health care expenditures are expected to challenge the fiscal sustainability even more in the coming years. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship and spillover effects between the health care expenditure and health outcome measured by the potential years of life lost as well as the marginal impact of the former on public accounts. Using data from 29 OECD countries over the period 1990–2017, we apply spatial econometrics as well as a fiscal analytic framework in order to calculate the fiscal impact of health care expenditure. We find a positive relationship between health care expenditures and health outcome which is translated fiscally into $0.035 per capita net revenue for every per capita dollar spent on health care.}

  abstract = {Background: Rapid point-of-care polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic tests generally provide a qualitative result of positive or negative only. Additional information about the relative viral load could be calculated. Such quantitative information might be useful for making treatment decisions. Methods: We enrolled students at a university health center who presented with cough and 1 additional flu-like symptom from December 2016 to February 2017. Data were collected before, during, and 5 days after the clinic visit. All those enrolled in the study received a point-of-care PCR test (cobas Liat). For those patients that tested positive for influenza A, we investigated correlations between the relative viral load and measures of disease severity and recovery. Results: One hundred thirty-five students tested positive for influenza A. We found a positive correlation between viral load and body temperature. Time since symptom onset seemed to have a negative correlation but was not statistically significant. We did not find any correlations between viral load and overall symptom severity or outcomes related to recovery. Conclusions: Although we found a correlation between relative viral load and body temperature, for our study population of young, overall healthy adults, we did not find that relative viral load provided additional information that could help in determining treatment and disease outcomes. It could be that viral load does provide useful additional information for other groups of patients, such as young children or older adults. Further studies on those populations are warranted.},

  abstract = {Communicable diseases are often virulent, i.e. they cause morbidity symptoms in those infected. While some symptoms may be transmission- enhancing, other symptoms are likely to reduce transmission potential. For human diseases, the reduction in transmission opportunities is commonly caused by reduced activity. There is limited data regarding the potential impact of virulence on transmission potential. We performed an exploratory data analysis of 324 influenza patients at a university health centre during the 2016/2017 influenza season. We classified symptoms as infectiousness-related or morbidity-related and calculated two scores. The scores were used to explore the relationship between infectiousness, morbidity (virulence), and activity level. We found a decrease in the activity level with increasing morbidity scores. There was no consistent pattern between an activity level and an infectiousness score. We also found a positive correlation between morbidity and infectiousness scores. Overall, we find that increasing virulence leads to increased infectiousness and reduced activity, suggesting a trade-off that can impact overall transmission potential. Our findings indicate that a reduction of systemic symptoms may increase host activity without reducing infectiousness. Therefore, interventions should target both systemic- and infectiousness-related symptoms to reduce overall transmission potential. Our findings can also inform simulation models that investigate the impact of different interventions on transmission.},

  abstract  = "The results of the report clearly show that in 2020, a year
               dominated by the emergence of COVID-19 and its associated health
               and economic crises, governments around the world rose to the
               challenge. Sharp increases in government spending on health at
               all country income levels underpinned the rise in health
               spending to a new high of US \$9 trillion (approximately 11\% of
               global GDP). Government health spending generally increased and
               offset declines in out-of-pocket spending. Importantly, the rise
               in government health spending was part of a much broader fiscal
               response to the pandemic. In high income and upper-middle income
               countries social protection spending also increased sharply in
               as governments attempted to cushion populations from the
               economic impacts of COVID-19. In contrast to health and social
               protection, growth in education spending was relatively subdued.
               Countries face the further challenge of sustaining increased
               public spending on health and other social sectors in the face
               of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and rising debt
               servicing. This also includes the challenge of sustaining
               external support for low income countries, which is essential
               for reducing ensuring poverty, ensuring access to health
               services and strengthening pandemic preparedness.",
